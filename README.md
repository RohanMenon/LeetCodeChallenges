# Welcome to my LeetCode Challenges Repository!

<img src = "Background Image.jpg">

## Hey guys!

My name is Rohan and I've created this respository to add my solutions to the problems in the monthly coding challenge hosted on [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/explore/). Although the coding challenges started last month (i.e. April, 2020), I got to know about them when the May challenge started since I've never used LeetCode before (I am (or was) an avid user of [**Hackerrank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/DeathStroke96)). So I thought why not restart my competitive coding streak and improve on it!

Since I can still solve the challenges from the month of April, I have started adding them [here](April), so do check those out too.

**NOTE: Since I missed the official deadlines for the April challenges, some questions are locked i.e. there will be atmost 6x4 + 1x1 = 25 problems and solutions for the month of April.** 

I welcome contructive criticism, especially when it comes to coding. So if you have time and think you can improve/optimize the solutions or even add solutions to the problems in other languages, do raise a PR for the same. Who knows, we might end up learning something entirely new :smile:!!

If you want to raise a PR, please follow [*this*](.github/pull_request_template.md). This is just to maintain uniformity.
