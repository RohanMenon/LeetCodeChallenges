# Welcome to my LeetCode Challenges Repository!

<img src = "Background Image.jpg">

## Hi fellow developer!

My name is Rohan and I've created this respository to add my solutions to the problems in the monthly coding challenge hosted on [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/). Although the coding challenges started last month (i.e. Arpil, 2020), I found time only to start the challenges in the month of May, 2020. Nevertheless, I'll still be solving previous month's challenges and will be updating them here, so do watch out for that!

I welcome contructive criticism, especially when it comes to coding. So if you have time and think you can improve/optimize the solutions I add or have added to this repository, do raise a PR for the same. Who knows, we might end up learning something entirely new :smile:!!

If you want to raise a PR, please follow [*pull_request_template.md*](.github/pull_request_template.md). This is just to maintain uniformity.
